# pre-undo README

The pre-undo extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the undo process by providing a visual cue before the actual undo operation is performed. When you press Ctrl+Z, the cursor will move to the line that will be affected by the undo operation, allowing you to see the changes that will occur. On the next Ctrl+Z press, the undo operation will be executed.

## Features


- Visual Cue for Undo: Moves the cursor to the line that will be affected by the undo operation, giving you a preview of the changes.
- Enhanced Undo Control: Allows you to confirm the undo operation by pressing Ctrl+Z again, ensuring you are aware of the changes being made.

## How It Works

1- First Ctrl+Z Press: The cursor moves to the line that will be affected by the undo operation, providing a visual indication of the upcoming change.
2- Second Ctrl+Z Press: The undo operation is executed, reverting the change as usual.

**Enjoy!**
